# SecureOps v0.0.1 — Beta Launch Readiness Report

**Date:** 2026-06-02 · **Branch:** `master` · **Remote:** github.com/aryasoni98/secureops
**Verdict:** ✅ **GO for beta** (as an audit / hardening / egress-control tool), with the scope caveats in §5.

---

## 1. Build & test

| Check | Local (macOS) | CI ubuntu | CI macOS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo build --workspace` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `cargo test --workspace` (165) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Release binaries (`secureops`, `secureops-daemon`) | ✅ stripped/LTO | — | — |

Last green CI run: workflow `CI` on `master`, both matrix jobs `success`.

## 2. GitHub Actions

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): build/test/clippy/fmt on ubuntu + macOS. Triggers on push to `master`, PRs, **and `v*` tags** (fixed — see §6).
- **publish-crates** (in CI, tag-gated): publishes 16 crates in dependency order. `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret is set. All 16 `secureops-*` names are **available** on crates.io.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): on `v*` tag → GitHub Release (notes from CHANGELOG) + `secureops` CLI binaries for linux-x86_64, linux-arm64 (via `cross`), macos-x86_64, macos-arm64.

## 3. Live runtime test (release binaries, realistic company config)

Config: gateway `0.0.0.0:8080` auth-off, egress allowlist `[api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com]`.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `init` | ✅ keystore + machine id |
| `audit --json` (pre) | score **18**, 3 critical, exit 2 (CI gate fires) |
| `harden --full` | ✅ applied |
| `audit --json` (post) | score **79**, critical **0**, exit 2 (remaining medium/low) |
| `status` / `behavioral` | ✅ |
| daemon egress proxy | ✅ ON `127.0.0.1:8889`, fail-closed, 2 allowlisted |
| ALLOW `api.anthropic.com` | ✅ tunnel established (HTTP 404 from real upstream) |
| ALLOW `api.openai.com` | ✅ tunnel established (HTTP 421 from real upstream) |
| DENY `github.com` | ✅ `403 Forbidden`, 0 bytes out |
| DENY `exfil.evil.com` | ✅ `403 Forbidden`, 0 bytes out |
| kill switch on → daemon | ✅ refuses to bring up enforcement |
| `export-incident` | ✅ bundle written (audit.json + incident.json) |

**Conclusion:** the out-of-band egress firewall enforces correctly against real internet endpoints using the shipped release binary.

## 4. Security / packaging hygiene

- No secrets in tracked files; `.DS_Store` removed + gitignored.
- MIT `LICENSE` present; all crates carry description + license.
- Inter-crate deps version-pinned (crates.io-publishable).
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` was shared in plaintext chat → **rotate after publish**.

## 5. Beta scope — what is and isn't active (truth in advertising)

**Active in the default beta:** security audit (OWASP-ASI mapped checks + scoring), hardening + rollback, runtime monitors (cost/credential/memory/skill), **egress enforcement** (HTTPS-CONNECT allowlist proxy + DNS sinkhole, fail-closed), kill switch, signed/hash-chained audit log, incident export.

**Gated OFF / not yet wired (Phase 4):**
- **Kernel PEP (eBPF/aya)** — `--features ebpf`; loader uses pre-0.13 aya API, not finalized; not invoked by the daemon.
- **Execution PEP host seccomp** — `--features seccomp`; filter not finalized, uncalled.
- **TPM signing** — `--features tpm`; `TpmSigner` is a scaffold (returns "not wired"). Default signing = OS-keychain ed25519.

So beta = **audit + harden + egress/monitor enforcement**, not full kernel-level enforcement. A company can run it live today for security posture scoring, config hardening, and egress allow-listing of agent traffic.

## 6. Fixes applied this cycle

- Initialized git, layered launch fixes on top of `first commit`; default branch `master`.
- Rewrote CI/release for the root layout; dropped sibling TS-shim jobs.
- Gated 3 Linux build landmines behind off-by-default features (tss-esapi/`tpm`, seccomp+libc/`seccomp`, aya/`ebpf`) — fixed red Linux CI.
- Fixed audit remediation text (real CLI commands, not non-existent `openclaw secureops` subcommands).
- Pinned inter-crate dep versions; added LICENSE; version 0.0.1 across the tree.
- Repointed repo URLs to `aryasoni98/secureops`; added `secureops-daemon` to publish list.
- **Fixed crates.io publish trigger** (CI now runs on `v*` tags, else publish-crates never fired).

## 7. Open items before/at tag

1. **Publish is irreversible** — `0.0.1` on crates.io is permanent (yank-only). Tag `v0.0.1` to ship.
2. **Publish not idempotent** — if the job dies mid-list, re-running errors on already-published crates; would need per-crate skip or manual completion.
3. **Docker/K8s deploy** — manifests + compose reviewed, **not** live-tested locally (no Docker running here).
4. `scripts/rename-repo.sh` — obsolete; recommend delete.
5. Rotate the crates.io token after first publish.
6. (cosmetic) GitHub Actions Node20 deprecation warnings — bump action versions before Sept 2026.

## 8. Recommendation

**Ship the beta.** Tag `v0.0.1` when ready to publish. Position it as a Rust security-audit + hardening + **egress-control** tool for OpenClaw agents; document that kernel/sandbox/TPM enforcement layers are feature-gated and arriving in a later phase.
